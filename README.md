# K-means-and-K-means++
the implement of k-means and k-means++

1. Generate 4 clusters using the following

```
import numpy as np
N = 100
mean1 = [6, 15]
mean2 = [6, 11]
mean3 = [16,15]
mean4 = [16,11]
cov = [[2, 0], [0, 2]]
np.random.seed(50)
X = np.random.multivariate_normal( mean1, cov, int(N/4))
X = np.concatenate ((X, np.random.multivariate_normal ( mean2, cov, int(N/4))))
X = np.concatenate ((X, np.random.multivariate_normal ( mean3, cov, int(N/4))))
X = np.concatenate ((X, np.random.multivariate_normal ( mean4, cov, int(N/4))))
```

2. Implement using Python K-means clustering with ùêæ = 4. Do not use existing functions. Set 
maximum number of iterations to 50. Comment your program. Run your program more 
than one time. Also evaluate the clustering result using SSE. 

   Comment on the performance. Identify situations when the method does well and when it 
does not. (40%)

3. Repeat step 2 but this time implement K-means++. (40%)

4. Comment on the relative performance of K-means and K-means++ qualitatively and 
quantitatively. (20%)
